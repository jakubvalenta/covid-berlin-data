The data come from the official press releases of the city of Berlin:
[Pressemitteilungen der Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Gesundheit, Pflege und
Gleichstellung](https://www.berlin.de/sen/gpg/service/presse/2020/).

The website of the city of Berlin is checked for a new press release every 30
minutes using
[covid-berlin-scraper](https://www.github.com/jakubvalenta/covid-berlin-scraper).

## Date

The date on each row of the data file is the date of the press release, unless
the press release was released before 12:00 (Berlin time), in which case the
date of the previous day is used. When several press releases were released on a
day, only the latest one is used.
