Until August 30, 2020, the data come from the official press releases of the

und Gleichstellung](https://www.berlin.de/sen/gpg/service/presse/2020/).

From August 31, 2020 to September 8, 2020, the data come from the table
[COVID-19 in Berlin, Verteilung in den
Bezirken](https://www.berlin.de/lageso/gesundheit/infektionsepidemiologie-infektionsschutz/corona/tabelle-bezirke/). These
data are missing the number of hospitalized and ICU patients.

Since September 9, 2020, the data come from the dashboard [COVID-19 in
Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/corona/lagebericht/desktop/corona.html).

The sources are checked for new data every 30 minutes using

## Date

The date on each row of the data file is the date of the press release, unless
the press release was released before 12:00 (Berlin time), in which case the
date of the previous day is used. When several press releases were released on a
day, only the latest one is used.
